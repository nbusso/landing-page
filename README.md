# landing-page

Landing Page project @ Project Odin's Foudations course

### Notes:

I used [dummyimage.com](https://dummyimage.com) for images, it's quite handy!

I'll probably revisit this one to make it more _'custom'_, right now I just focused on getting it the way the assigment said.
I'm kinda hyped for js and I know its the next module so I'll get right into it!
